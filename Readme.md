# Lombiq UIKit for Orchard Core



## About

This module contains reusable shapes like text editors, custom-style checkboxes, dropdown editors, and in the future potentially more complex editors. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PONfn2K8AHg) you can also see a demo of it.


## Documentation

Add the module to your solution and enable the `Lombiq UIKit - Showcase page` feature if you want to check out the currently available shapes. You can see them under `~/UIKitShowcase` after the feature is enabled. The example code for using these shapes can be seen in *[Views/Showcase/Showcase.cshtml](Views/Showcase/Showcase.cshtml)*.
This module contains only those stylings which are needed for these shapes to work.

### Custom class and id

For your own styling you can override the default class stylings, or you can create a new class and add it to the shape blockvia the `BlockClassName` parameter.

If it is needed to add an Id for the container block, then you can do that with the `BlockId` parameter.
